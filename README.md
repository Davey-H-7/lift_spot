# Background
- Initially created as a run tracker, I decided to rework this to help me with tracking weight lifting instead.
- Uses TypeScript, React, Node.js and Express to build my experience in those technologies.
- Currently Utilises a Mongodb server but I may end up changing to a SQL one down the line.
- A Key goal of this project is to practice testing in JavaScript and React.
